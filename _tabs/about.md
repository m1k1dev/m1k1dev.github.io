Hello dear reader!

I am Mirel, but my friends call me **Miki**. I am a software developer with ~10 years of experience in the industry.
This is my blog, where I write about software development. It allows me to document my thoughts, ideas,
experiments and projects, and share them with the community (and with myself) in a structured format.
I hope you find my content interesting, useful, and - above all - <u>fun</u> - as that's what it's all about.

Bye
